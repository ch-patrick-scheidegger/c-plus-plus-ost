Function parameters can have a function type themselves. This allows passing functions as arguments to other functions. Such functions are also called higher-order functions. In C++ function function parameter types can be values, pointer or references, with similar semantics. Those types of parameters do not allow passing lambdas with captures as arguments. Specifying a parameter type of `std::function` is more flexible, as it can also take such arguments.
