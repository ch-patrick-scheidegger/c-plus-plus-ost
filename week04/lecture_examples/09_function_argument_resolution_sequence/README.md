Intuitively, one might expect that function arguments are evaluated from left to right. If the evaluation does not have a side-effect, this actually does not even matter and the assumption is not problematic. But if there are side effects in the evaluation, specifically, side-effects that influence each other (like read-modify-write sequences), the order matters. The evaluation order in C++ is unspecified. If the expected result depends on an expected order of evaluation, the behavior is even undefined.
